# Welcome to Nyctibius

Welcome to the official GitHub Pages site for Nyctibius! This site serves as the central hub for all documentation, resources, and updates related to the library.

## Introduction

The Python package [Nyctibius]  is an extraction, transformation, loading and AI-assisted query and visualization (ETL-AI QV) tool designed to simplify the intricate process of collecting and merging data from multiple sources into a unified relational database structure and visualize or querying it using natural language.

## Features

- **Extraction:**
  - Seamlessly retrieve data from online data sources through web scraping, as well as from local files.
  - Support for various data formats, including `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.txt`, `.sav`, and compressed files, ensuring versatility in sourcing information.

- **Transformation:**
  - Consolidating extracted data into pandas DataFrame.
  - Optimizing the transformation process of large files.
    - Implement parallel processing for large files.
    - Use efficient data structures to reduce memory footprint.
  - Effectively manage data inconsistencies and discrepancies for enhanced accuracy.
    - Apply anomaly detection algorithms.

- **Load:**
  - Consolidating transformed data into a cohesive relational database.

- **Query:**
  - Conduct precise queries and apply transformations to meet specific criteria.

- **AI Query & Visualization:**
  - Using natural language input to query data (Answers from values to subsets)
  - Using natural language input to create simple visualizations of data

  
## Who should use Nyctibius?

Nyctibius is ideal for data analysts, scientists, and researchers who frequently handle large volumes of data from varied sources and are looking for a streamlined way to consolidate, query, and visualize their data. It's also a great tool for developers working on projects that require the integration of disparate data sets into a single, manageable format. Additionally, business intelligence professionals and decision-makers will find Nyctibius invaluable for generating insights through natural language queries and visualizations, making complex data more accessible and actionable. In essence, anyone looking to simplify their data workflows, from extraction to visualization, and leverage AI for natural language querying will benefit greatly from using Nyctibius.
