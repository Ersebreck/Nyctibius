## Usage

To use the Nyctibius package, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Python script:

   ```python
   from nyctibius import Harmonizer
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `Harmonizer` class:

   ```python
   harmonizer = Harmonizer()
   ```

3. Extract data from online sources and create a list of data information:

   ```python
   url = 'https://www.example.com'
   depth = 0
   ext = 'csv'
   list_datainfo = harmonizer.extract(url=url, depth=depth, ext=ext)
   harmonizer = Harmonizer(list_datainfo)
   ```

4. Load the data from the list of data information and merge it into a relational database:

   ```python
   results = harmonizer.load()
   ```

5. Import the modifier module and create an instance of the `Modifier` class:

   ```python
   from nyctibius.db.modifier import Modifier
   modifier = Modifier(db_path='../../data/output/nyctibius.db')
   ```
   
6. Perfom modifications:

   ```python
   tables = modifier.get_tables()
   print(tables)
   ```
   
7. Import the querier module and create an instance of the `Querier` class:

   ```python
   from nyctibius.db.querier import Querier
   querier = Querier(db_path='data/output/nyctibius.db')
   ```

8. Perform queries:

   ```python
   df = querier.select(table="Estructura CHC_2017").execute()
   print(df)
   ```
