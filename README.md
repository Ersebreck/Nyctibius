## Installation


You can install the Nyctibius package using pip. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system; the package requires Python version 3.7 or higher.

```shell
pip install nyctibius
```

## Usage

To use the Nyctibius package, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Python script:

   ```python
   from nyctibius import Harmonizer
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `Harmonizer` class:

   ```python
   harmonizer = Harmonizer()
   ```

3. Extract data from online sources and create a list of data information:

   ```python
   url = 'https://www.example.com'
   depth = 0
   ext = 'csv'
   list_datainfo = harmonizer.extract(url=url, depth=depth, ext=ext)
   harmonizer = Harmonizer(list_datainfo)
   ```

4. Load the data from the list of data information and merge it into a relational database:

   ```python
   results = harmonizer.load()
   ```

5. Import the querier module and create an instance of the `Querier` class:

   ```python
   from nyctibius.sql.querier import Querier
   querier = Querier()
   ```
   
6. Perfom queries and transformations:

   ```python
   querier.execute_query('SELECT * FROM table_name')
   querier.get_tables()
   querier.get_columns('table_name')
   querier.rename_table("table_name", "new_table_name")
   querier.rename_column("table_name", "column_name", "new_column_name")
   querier.rename_table_columns("table_name", ['column_1', 'column_2', 'column_3', ...]))
   querier.set_primary_key("table_name", "column_name")
   querier.set_foreign_key("table_name", "fk_column_name", "referenced_table_name", "referenced_column_name")
   ```
