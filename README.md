The Python package Nyctibius is designed to streamline the complex task of gathering and consolidating sociodemographic data from various sources into a cohesive relational database. Nyctibius empowers users to effortlessly unify custom data sets from diverse socio-demographic sources, ensuring that they can work with up-to-date and comprehensive information in a seamless manner. This package facilitates the process of creating a harmonized repository of socio-demographic data, simplifying data management and analysis for users across various domains.

## Features

- **Extraction:**
  - Seamlessly retrieve data from online data sources through web scraping, as well as from local files.
  - Support for various data formats, including `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.txt`, `.sav`, and compressed files, ensuring versatility in sourcing information.

- **Transformation:**
  - Consolidating extracted data into pandas DataFrame.
    - Ensure data types are consistent.
    - Handle missing values appropriately.
  - Optimizing the transformation process of large files.
    - Implement parallel processing for large files.
    - Use efficient data structures to reduce memory footprint.
  - Effectively manage data inconsistencies and discrepancies for enhanced accuracy.
    - Apply anomaly detection algorithms.
    - Use data validation frameworks to ensure quality.

- **Load:**
  - Consolidating transformed data into a cohesive relational database.

- **Query:**
  - Conduct precise queries and apply transformations to meet specific criteria.

- **AI Query & Visualization:**
  - Using natural language input to query data (Answers from values to subsets)
  - Using natural language input to create simple visualizations of data

  
## Who should use Nyctibius?

Nyctibius is ideal for data analysts, scientists, and researchers who frequently handle large volumes of data from varied sources and are looking for a streamlined way to consolidate, query, and visualize their data. It's also a great tool for developers working on projects that require the integration of disparate data sets into a single, manageable format. Additionally, business intelligence professionals and decision-makers will find Nyctibius invaluable for generating insights through natural language queries and visualizations, making complex data more accessible and actionable.

## Installation

For full documentation, please refer to the [Nyctibius documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f2im1gzYpxrvfmiPllAvYWC21-ZzYLNg/view?usp=sharing).

You can install the Nyctibius package using pip. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system; the package requires Python version 3.7 or higher.

```shell
pip install nyctibius
```

## Usage

To use the Nyctibius package, follow these steps:

1. Import the package in your Python script:

   ```python
   from nyctibius import Harmonizer
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `Harmonizer` class:

   ```python
   harmonizer = Harmonizer()
   ```

3. Extract data from online sources and create a list of data information:

   ```python
   url = 'https://www.example.com'
   depth = 0
   ext = 'csv'
   list_datainfo = harmonizer.extract(url=url, depth=depth, ext=ext)
   harmonizer = Harmonizer(list_datainfo)
   ```

4. Load the data from the list of data information and merge it into a relational database:

   ```python
   results = harmonizer.load()
   ```

5. Import the modifier module and create an instance of the `Modifier` class:

   ```python
   from nyctibius.db.modifier import Modifier
   modifier = Modifier(db_path='../../data/output/nyctibius.db')
   ```
   
6. Perfom modifications:

   ```python
   tables = modifier.get_tables()
   print(tables)
   ```
   
7. Import the querier module and create an instance of the `Querier` class:

   ```python
   from nyctibius.db.querier import Querier
   querier = Querier(db_path='data/output/nyctibius.db')
   ```

8. Perform queries:

   ```python
   df = querier.select(table="Estructura CHC_2017").execute()
   print(df)
   ```
